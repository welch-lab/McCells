# Processed Data

This directory contains processed data and cached ontology objects.

## Files

### `ontology.pkl`

This file is a cached `pronto.Ontology` object, which represents the Cell Ontology (CL).
It is generated by `src/data_pipeline/cache_ontology.py`.
This file is the primary source of truth for ontology information in the pipeline.

### Run-Specific Artifacts (e.g., `YYYY-MM-DD_*.pt`, `YYYY-MM-DD_*.pkl`, `YYYY-MM-DD_*.csv`)

These files are generated by `run_preprocessing.py` and represent the preprocessed data for a specific run (e.g., for a particular subgraph of the ontology).

- `YYYY-MM-DD_cell_parent_mask.pt`: A PyTorch tensor representing the parent mask for internal loss calculation.
- `YYYY-MM-DD_ontology_df.csv`: A CSV file representing the ontology hierarchy for the processed subgraph.
- `YYYY-MM-DD_mapping_dict_df.csv`: A CSV file mapping CL IDs to their encoded values.
- `YYYY-MM-DD_leaf_values.pkl`: A pickled list of CL IDs identified as leaf nodes in the processed subgraph.
- `YYYY-MM-DD_internal_values.pkl`: A pickled list of CL IDs identified as internal nodes in the processed subgraph.
